# The Goal Standard

What a goal or epic must contain before an executor — human or agent — can
run with it and not guess. The craft workflow builds to this standard, the
grade workflow scores against it, the split workflow refuses input that
fails it. The standard is tool-neutral: it describes a markdown document.

## Vocabulary

A **goal** states one bounded outcome. An **epic** is a goal big enough to
need child items. Same shape, same sections — the only difference is that an
epic ends with children.

## The document shape

A crafted goal is one markdown document with these sections, in this order:

```
## Description         situation and root cause; ends with Out of scope
## Goal                one sentence: outcome + "so that"
## Requirements        - [ ] properties the solution must have
## Acceptance Criteria - [ ] observable tests, each with a verification method
## Plan                fat-marker sketch; epics: the slice sketch
## Notes               Appetite, decisions, Q:/A: open questions
```

## The four properties

A goal is bounded when it carries all four: **purpose, boundary, budget,
proof**. Each lives in a fixed place.

### Purpose — why, so ties break your way

- `## Goal`: one sentence. The outcome plus a "so that" clause naming who it
  serves. Outcome means a changed state of the world, not an activity — if
  the sentence is a verb phrase like "migrate X", ask what is true afterwards.
- `## Description`: the situation and root cause, in the author's own words.
  Preserve the original phrasing that started the item; clarify around it,
  never replace it.

### Boundary — the fence against helpful drift

- **Out of scope**, at the end of `## Description`: 2–3 explicit exclusions,
  the adjacent things a helpful executor would otherwise wander into. This
  list does more work than the in-scope list. Zero exclusions means the
  boundary was never drawn.
- `## Plan`: the fat-marker sketch — main flows, files or modules expected to
  change, the existing pattern to follow ("do it like the X handler"). Point
  at ground truth; never paste code or schemas that will drift stale.
- Decisions already made (library, naming, approach) and decisions expressly
  left to the executor ("either is fine, pick one and note it") go in
  `## Notes`.
- Dependencies — what must exist first, and territory shared with in-flight
  work — get named in `## Notes`.

### Budget — the stopping rule

- One `Appetite:` line in `## Notes`: what the work is worth in time ("two
  evenings", "a week"), plus what gets cut first when it runs tight. An
  executor with no appetite gold-plates forever.
- Known-hard sub-problems (rabbit holes) are patched in `## Plan` before the
  goal ships: a declared simplification, a cut, or a spike-first tripwire
  ("if X takes more than Y, stop and report"). "We'll figure out X" never
  ships.

### Proof — done is a fact, not a feeling

- `## Requirements`: properties the solution must have. Rationale may ride
  inline.
- `## Acceptance Criteria`: externally observable end-to-end tests, each with
  its verification method — a command to run, a behavior to observe ("with
  the laptop off, a capture typed on the phone lands in the home inbox").
  A criterion nobody can mechanically check is a criterion the executor will
  claim is met.

**Fewer, sharper.** Every checkbox is a promise someone must later tick or
decline with a reason. At most 6 requirements and 5 acceptance criteria —
one condition each, short declarative sentence, no trailing period.

## Failure modes

Name these when grading; each detect line is mechanical.

| Failure | Detect |
|---|---|
| Mirage outcome | No sentence says what is true afterwards |
| Frankenstein goal | "and" joins two outcomes with different success tests |
| Missing out-of-scope | Zero explicit exclusions anywhere |
| Unfalsifiable criteria | A criterion no command or observation settles |
| Solutioneering | Method prescribed, "why" absent — no trade-off is decidable |
| No appetite | Nothing says when to stop polishing |
| Rabbit hole unpatched | "We'll figure out X" left in scope |
| Iceberg | Enumerating touched states/cases keeps growing the list |
| Grab-bag epic | Children share a theme but no demoable whole |
| Stale-context brief | Pasted code or schema instead of a pointer to it |

## The ready test

A goal is bounded when every question below is answered in the document or
explicitly left to the executor:

1. Outcome — what is true afterwards, and how observed
2. Why — what breaks or is lost if skipped
3. Out of scope — what a helpful executor must not touch
4. Appetite — worth how much, cut what first
5. Constraints and decided decisions — what is already fixed
6. Dependencies — what must exist first, who shares the territory
7. Rabbit holes — the hard 10%, patched
8. Proof — every criterion checkable, method named

Open questions live in `## Notes` as `Q:` lines, resolved by editing the line
to `A:`; an unanswered `Q:` fails the test. An empty section beats a
fabricated one.

## Epic extras

An epic additionally sketches its slices in `## Plan`: 3–7 candidate
children, each a vertical slice — demoable end-to-end on its own, never a
layer ("the DB part"). Children carry a one-line pointer to the parent's
purpose so the executor can break ties without asking. Slices are candidates;
execution may reshape them.
